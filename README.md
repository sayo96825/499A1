### 499A1

This is a individual git hub eercise for COSC499.

In the main branch there is a ist with String and integer data type.
On the integer branch, there is the feature to put all the integer together and it will sort the number.
On the String branch, there is the deture to put all the String sorted in alphabetical order.
It is very simple feture. You just need to run it. 
There are 3 branch in total and it is merged successfully.

For the video demo, I had gitbun and VSC open in side by side and did built-in screen capture.
But I realized it was only catureing the github window. 
After looking into it, my understanding is that I need other program to do multi windows capture or edit two video together.
I am just sending in the making change part of the video separately at this time.
