### 499A1

This is a individual git hub exercise for COSC499.

In the main branch there is a list with String and integer data type.
On the integer branch, there is the feature to put all the integer together and it will sort the number.
On the String branch, there is the deture to put all the String sorted in alphabetical order.
It is very simple feture. You just need to run it. 
There are 3 branch in total and it is merged successfully.

For the video demo, I had GitHub and VSC open side by side and did a built-in screen capture. But I realized it was only capturing the GitHub window. After looking into it, my understanding is that I need another program to do multi-windows capture or edit two videos together.

I sent the making change part of the video separately through Canvas at this time.
